    Dr Radmila Juric is a computer scientist, with a long-term research interest in semantic technologies and creating computational meaning, underpinned with formalisations and description logic.  Her interests in computational models based on reasoning, highlighted the problematic nature of our computational algorithms when they either address problems across disciplines, or compute solutions for complex situations, which would satisfy humans.  She is also interested in accountability an obscurity of modern computational algorithms and would like to move research towards ternary computing, which might address numerous worries we have about the future of computing at the beginning of the third decade in the 21st century.
