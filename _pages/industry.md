### Challenges in AI/GenAI Design and Process for Industry

Today, Academia and Industry are faced with generational challenges in Artificial Intelligence not seen since the Industrial Revolution. As the AI/GenAI community creates vast new and novel opportunities at a merciless velocity, it consequently, creates challenges with lack of understanding and immature designs, processes, research, engineering, while also exposing gaps in formal AI/GenAI design and process education. Other resulting factors include a general fear of unknown AI/GenAI technologies, as well as, system ambiguity and disguised complexities. It is imperative to mitigate these in critical environments (e.g., medical, financial, cyber defense and so on), or otherwise invite possibilities of irreparable harm or damage emerging from employing substantially increased levels of AI/GenAI automation/autonomy.

Therefore, in order to better serve modern business leaders with guidance to innovate, mitigate risk, and capitalize on novel advancements in AI/GenAI, the Society for Design and Process Science (SDPS) is uniquely bringing together the advanced academic research community with industry to more qualitatively harness the power of formal AI/GenAI Design and Process to accelerate Science and Business.
