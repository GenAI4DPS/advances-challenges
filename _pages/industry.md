### Challenges in AI/GenAI Design and Process for Industry

We invite companies from various sectors to attend the Society for Design and
Process Science (SDPS) 2024 International Conference, 6-9 October 2024 in Bologna, Italy, and
debate current challenges in applying AI/GenAI, and comment on future trends and
expectations we may have from the AI technologies.

The [SDPS](https://www.sdpsnet.org/sdps/) has been at the forefront of
[transdisciplinary research and transformative science and engineering](https://www.sdpsnet.org/sdps/index.php/about-sdps/history) for almost 30
years. Our international events are forums for challenging advances in process and
design science, computing and software technologies and their impact on research
and education. 

We are delighted to be back to Bologna, known for their old University and a very
vibrant science and research communities. This is an opportunity to address the
main motto of the 26th SDPS International Conference that spans a broad spectrum
of topics, focusing on AI and Generative AI technologies and their application in
design and process science.

Today, Academia and Industry are faced with generational challenges in Artificial
Intelligence, not seen since the Industrial Revolution. As the AI/GenAI community
creates vast new and novel opportunities at a merciless velocity, it consequently,
creates challenges with lack of understanding, immature designs, processes,
research and engineering, while also exposing gaps in formal AI/GenAI design and
process education.

Other resulting factors include a general fear of unknown AI/GenAI technologies, as
well as system ambiguity and disguised complexities. It is imperative to mitigate
these in critical environments (e.g., medical, financial, automation, cyber defence to
mention just a few) or otherwise, invite possibilities of irreparable harm or damage
emerging from employing substantially increased levels of AI/GenAI in automation/
autonomy.

However, we will also be able to focus to the EU initiatives on boosting research and
industrial capacity in relation to AI and debate questions like:

- Does your business enjoy the benefits of trustworthy AI which serves your
business model, respects EU values and rules?
- Would you consider collaboration with AI start-ups in your region and could
you benefit from them?
- Have you heard of GenAI4EU? Do you use GenAI and thus becoming a part
of EU strategic industrial and large open innovation systems for fostering
collaboration between AI startups and deployers of AI in industry as well as
the public sector.
- Are you aware of the regulatory framework on AI in the EU?

Finally the EU claims that we can build trustworthy AI which could result in a safe
and innovation-friendly environment for users, developers and deployers.

- How likely is it that you or we can build it?
- Have you covered, within your companies, all levels of risks associated with
the development of and using existing solutions based on AI?

Therefore, to better serve modern business leaders, with guidance to innovate,
mitigate risk, capitalize on novel advancements in AI/GenAI and address all EU
initiatives, the SDPS is uniquely bringing together the advanced academic research
community with industry to more qualitatively harness the power of formal AI/GenAI
Design and Process to accelerate Science and Business. Our joint panels may
discuss a range of issues of using AI/GenAI in Manufacturing, Automation.
Transportation, Logistics/Supply Chain Management, Smart Cities, Medicine,
Pharmaceuticals, Natural Sciences, Governance and Education.

Our Pegram Committee would love to hear from companies interested in our event.
Feel free to contact any of our committee members using emails.
