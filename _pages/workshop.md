The GenAI4DPS Conference Workshops are the following:

<u>Workshop 1: AI and GenAI in Biomedicine and Healthcare: Discoveries and Knowledge Dissemination</u>

This workshop evaluates the power of AI and GenAI in biomedicine, medicine, and healthcare, focusing on their most desirable outcomes: discoveries of scientific knowledge and experiments, research results, and empirical evidence, supported by knowledge dissemination across various biomedical domains, which directly impact medicine and healthcare.

We are all aware of the ambiguity and complexity of applying AI/GenAI in science, but the advances in software tools and user-friendly operating environments, which enable the use of transformer architectures, various LLMs, GenAI agents, and human involvement through prompting mechanisms, started making a difference in discoveries and knowledge dissemination. There is no area in the fields of biomedicine, medicine and healthcare which has not been affected: from drug discoveries, clinical trials, public health and epidemiology to medical diagnostics, personalised medicine, patient empowerment and healthcare management. However, advances in two fields have left us surprised and enthusiastic. These are the successes of using GenAI in medical imaging and protein folding. Both have contributed towards creating incredible biomedical information
which could not have been envisaged just 12 months ago.

In this workshop, we would like to demonstrate and debate the role of GenAI in knowledge discoveries and evaluate the efficiency and reliability of powerful text/image/graphics/multimedia creation and retrieval across the biomedical science. The amount of data and knowledge generated is unprecedented and we practically have no means of their instant, effective, and accurate discoveries and sharing. Numerous discoveries in biology, chemistry, medicine, healthcare, computer science, and biomedicine itself are happening now, as we speak/write, and it is plausible to expect that GenAI can help in finding and disseminating new knowledge. We will illustrate, evaluate, and debate 5 different examples of using GenAI and associated
technologies in obtaining and composing information which could answer difficult questions we may have in

a) enzyme (de)activation in fighting diseases and creating drugs,

b) treatment plan creation for addressing mental health symptoms,

c) one-drug-multiple-targets formulations in Polypharmacology

d) data discoveries and their semantic overlapping for continuous drug repurposing and

e) evaluation of Tf/TfR endosomal recycling in the cellular process.

<u>Workshop 2: AI/GenAI for Secondary to Advanced University Education</u>

Review AI/GenAI Tools and Services: The Evolution of the Gen AI Landscape and Education Challenges

This workshop addresses a review of the current Gen AI landscape, education challenges, and usage of Gen AI IN and FOR education. We have an opportunity to debate and challenge the impact of AI and GenAI in education and focus on some of the following topics:

a) Current global education challenges and environments

b) Current landscape of GenAI tools and services: the impact of GenAI technologies to questions of acceptance and potential cheating

c) Opportunities for advancing education and methods for implementing AI in and for education

Please contact John Carbone.

<u>Workshop 3: AI/GenAI for Transportation and Autonomous Vehicles</u>

This workshop addresses our new era of transportation where software technology, engineering, and automation, supported by AI/GenAI technologies, have made a difference in the way we perceive and envisage the future of mobility in either reality or cyber-physical spaces. Autonomous vehicles have made a huge impact on modern transportation, because they have turned our
perception on what the automation can bring upside down. They have reshaped our vision on the level of autonomy we can expect from items, vehicles, humans and transportation infrastructure for achieving common goals: autonomous decision making in constantly changeable environments, and reasoning which may resemble a human way of managing situations in traffic.

We have an opportunity to debate and challenge the impact of AI and GenAI in modern transportation and focus on some of the following topics:

a) Changes in modern transportation: from the impact of software and AI technologies to
questions of acceptance and trust in autonomous transport

b) Changes in automotive industry in the light of advances in AI algorithmic computing which
create predictive inference upon excessive amounts of generated data

c) Challenges in autonomous transportation: security, safety, privacy, ethical/moral issues with
decision making supported by AI

d) Generative AI for managing productivity and safety along a) the production line of a vehicle and
b) the vehicles automated design.

e) Facilitating machine learning and prediction in constantly changing situations in transport

f) Generative AI in transportation for addressing safety, security and trust in automation and
autonomy in general

g) GenAI for customer relationship in transportation, and vehicle communications.

h) GenAI assistant as a driver
