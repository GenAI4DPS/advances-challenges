The GenAI4DPS Conference Workshops are the following:

1. Workshop 1: <u>AI and GenAI in Biomedicine and Healthcare: Discoveries and Knowledge Dissemination</u>

This workshop evaluates the power of AI and GenAi in biomedicine, medicine and healthcare, focusing on their most desirable outcomes: discoveries of scientific knowledge and experiments, research results, and empirical evidence, supported by knowledge dissemination across various biomedical domains, which directly impact medicine and healthcare deliveries.

We are all aware of the ambiguity and complexity of and applying AI/GenAI in science, but the advances in software tools and user-friendly operating environments, which enable the use of transformer architectures, various LLMs, GenAI agents and human involvement through prompting mechanisms, started making a difference in discoveries and knowledge dissemination. There is no area in the fields of biomedicine, medicine and healthcare which has not been affected: from drug discoveries, clinical trials, public health and epidemiology to medical diagnostics, personalised medicine, patient empowerment and healthcare management. However, advances in two fields have left us puzzled, surprised and enthusiastic. These are the successes of using Gen/AI in medical imaging and protein folding. Both have contributed towards creating incredible biomedical information which could not have been envisaged just 12 months ago.

In this workshop we would like to demonstrate and debate the role of GenAI in knowledge discoveries and evaluate the efficiency and reliability of the powerful text/image/graphics/multimedia creation and retrieval across the biomedical science. The amount of data and knowledge generated is unprecedented and we practically have no means of their instant, effective and accurate discoveries and sharing. Numerous discoveries in biology, chemistry, medicine, healthcare, computer science and biomedicine itself are happening now, as we speak/write and it is plausible that GenAI can help in finding new knowledge and disseminating it We will show, evaluate and debate 5 different examples of using GenAI and associated technologies in obtaining and composing information which could answer difficult questions we may have in

a) enzyme (de)activation in fighting diseases and creating drugs,
b) treatment plan creation for addressing mental health symptoms,
c) one-drug-multiple-targets formulations in Polypharmacology
d) data discoveries and their semantic overlapping for continuous drug repurposing and
e) evaluation of Tf/TfR endosomal recycling in the cellular process.
