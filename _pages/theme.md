The main motto of the 26th SDPS International Conference spans a broad spectrum of topics, focusing on AI and Generative AI technologies and their application in design and process science.

In this instance we have the opportunity to debate misconceptions about the power, suitability, success and fear in using the technology across industries and therefore Track 1 would, amongst other issues of misconceptions of using AI/GenAI search for the way of harnessing the power of formal AI/GenAI Design and Process to accelerate Science, Business and Engineering.

Knowing that the unexpected outcome and success of GenAI technologies, dependent on the widely accepted transformers architecture, is based on language models, our Task 2 looks at the challenges in this field. We would be interested in 
debating proficiency, linguistic transformation, and the lack of semantic interpretation of text interpretation, which affects the application of GenAI in general.

The spread of AI technologies has also made their acceptance in applied science very vocal. Track 3 describes a few, out of many possibilities, where AI/GenAI is used in resolving problems in applied science and may have an impact on scientific
processes and research.

Creating operating environments where we can run AI/GenAI solutions would require the definition of computational platforms and environments in which they co-habit with a spectrum of applications of AI. Track 4 offers synergy of both: technology platforms and applications of Ai/GenAI which bring solutions across problem domains.

It remains to be seen how far we can go in using the current format of AI/GenAI technologies in design and process science and we hope that the conference would highlight <u>“what the future holds”</u>. What we expect from design and process science in the light of massive content generation and manipulation across disciplines.

The GenAI4DPS 2024 Conference Themes are the following (but not limited to)
