  <p class="bio">
    Radmila Juric worked for 25 years in the UK higher education, involved in the delivery of
information systems and computer science and business programs, and 7 years in the
Norwegian higher education focusing on engineering environments and teaching software
development and architectures in cyber physical spaces. Before her academic carrier, she
worked as a software engineer in the banking industry, mostly on the IBM mainframes and
DB2.
    
Her research interest spans various disciplines, ranging from interactions in pervasive
computing with emphasis on cognitive, cultural and behavioural issues, and their
applications in healthcare, to architectures and frameworks for achieving interoperability in
software intensive systems. She is particularly interested in creating algorithms which
shape the current definition of Artificial Intelligence and analysing the human involvement
in creating intelligent programmable spaces, for the purpose of exploiting the power of
predictive and logic inference in modern computing. This includes issues of obscurity,
reliability, bias and potential harm of the AI algorithms and the way we perceive the role of
data science in the modern computing and in education is also The domain of research
interest is wide: from personalised healthcare and precision medicine, biomedical and
translational semantics and drug repurposing, and discoveries, to the IoT and intelligent
computational edge, cyber physical security, transportation and automation, urban
emergencies and humanitarian crises.
