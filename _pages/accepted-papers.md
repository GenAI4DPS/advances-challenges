**Title** - Mediating Mental Disorder Diagnosis and Treatments through Computational Psychiatry
**Abstract** - This paper illustrates the potential of mediating diagnosis and treatments of mental disorders by promoting computational models, which could be used in psychiatry. The mediation would have three different aspects. Firstly it would be context aware in terms of patient’s a) symptoms of mental disorders, b) social and personal environments and c) evidence of potential deviations in brain biology. Secondly, the mediation would require a synergy of disciplines and expertise in social science, neurobiology and psychiatry. Thirdly, it would require revisiting the term “computational psychiatry” by deploying the most suitable software technologies which would directly result in the mediation of mental disorder diagnosis. This would mean that the mediation cannot be solely based on co-relation between mental symptoms and mental disorders. It would leave open doors for potential changes in identifying and confirming mental disorders and their treatments, by looking at semantics overlapping between the terms involved in diagnosing mental disorders and impact they may have on each other. Inevitably, this proposal will blur barriers between disciplines of medical science and add social science into perspective of mediation the best possible solution for a particular patient.

**Title** - AI Enabling Design Thinking: Exploring the Impact of Generative AI on Creative Design
**Abstract** - Design is in a new era following the introduction of Generative AI (Gen AI), which offers tools that can automate different aspects of creative processes, thereby enhancing them. These tools provide opportunities for integrating generative AI into design. However, several ethical issues, including biases, need to be considered while adopting this technology. Biases caused by training data often result in non-inclusive and repetitive outcomes, hence constraining creativity and perpetuating stereotypes. This research investigates how generative AI can be employed under the framework of Design Thinking to trigger inventiveness, along with the need for structured ethical guidelines. After evaluating 30 different AI tools, we discovered that Generative AI can be utilized in various stages of Design Thinking depending on its functionality. Furthermore, the discussion includes the importance of prompt engineering, data diversity in AI models, and how human-AI collaboration can enhance the quality of AI-generated content and transform the creative industries.
