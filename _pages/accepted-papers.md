  title={Mediating Mental Disorder Diagnosis and Treatments through Computational Psychiatry},
  author={Radmila Juric},
  abstract={This paper illustrates the potential of mediating diagnosis and treatments of mental disorders 
            by promoting computational models, which could be used in psychiatry. The mediation would have 
            three different aspects. Firstly it would be context aware in terms of patient’s a) symptoms of 
            mental disorders, b) social and personal environments and c) evidence of potential deviations in 
            brain biology. Secondly, the mediation would require a synergy of disciplines and expertise in 
            social science, neurobiology and psychiatry. Thirdly, it would require revisiting the term 
            “computational psychiatry” by deploying the most suitable software technologies which would directly 
            result in the mediation of mental disorder diagnosis. This would mean that the mediation cannot be 
            solely based on co-relation between mental symptoms and mental disorders. It would leave open doors 
            for potential changes in identifying and confirming mental disorders and their treatments, by looking 
            at semantics overlapping between the terms involved in diagnosing mental disorders and impact they may 
            have on each other. Inevitably, this proposal will blur barriers between disciplines of medical science 
            and add social science into perspective of mediation the best possible solution for a particular patient.},
