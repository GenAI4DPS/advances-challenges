# Aims and scope

The 26th International Conference of the Society of Design and Process Science on Advances and Challenges of Applying AI/GenAI in Design and Process Science (GenAI4DPS 2024) is going to be held on October 6-9, Bologna, Italy. 

[GenAI4DPS 2024](https://genai4dps.github.io/advances-challenges) focuses on the impact of AI and GenAI on the design and process of applications now and beyond. It is funded by [SDPS](https://www.sdpsnet.org/sdps/), the forefront of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research for over 28 years. 

Researchers and Technologists willing to participate in the conference should submit a paper through the EasyChair, passing through a double-blind review phase.

Ths submission deadline is June, 15, 2024. Accepted papers will be published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
