    Dr. Elisabetta Ronchieri is a computer science engineer who held a PhD in Automation, Bioengineering and Robotics in 2007 at the University of Pisa. Since 2001 she has been working as a Researcher in Technology at the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN). She is currently a member of the Distributed Systems (DS) group in the Software Development and Distributed Systems (SDDS) department at INFN CNAF, the INFN National Center dedicated to research and development on IT technologies, located in Bologna, Italy. From 2014 to 2017 she collaborated with the University of Ferrara as an Adjunct Professor teaching Computer Science at the Bachelor degree in Economics. Since 2019 she has started collaborating with the University of Bologna as an Adjunct Professor teaching Machine Learning Systems for Data Science at the Master degree in Statistical Sciences. She does research in Software Engineering, Big Data Technologies, Information and Data Science, particularly with respect to anomaly detection, text analysis, text classification, and clustering in data mining applications.

    Radmila Juric is a computer scientist, with a long-term research interest in semantic technologies and creating computational meaning, underpinned with formalisations and description logic.  Her interests in computational models based on reasoning, highlighted the problematic nature of our computational algorithms when they either address problems across disciplines, or compute solutions for complex situations, which would satisfy humans.  She is also interested in accountability an obscurity of modern computational algorithms and would like to move research towards ternary computing, which might address numerous worries we have about the future of computing at the beginning of the third decade in the 21st century.

    Professor Patrick Then heads School of Information and Communication Technologies at Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus and Health Informatics cluster at Swinburne Melbourne Data Science Institute. He is the founder and director of Swinburne Sarawak’s Digital Innovation Precinct and Centre for Digital Futures. He is the thought leader in health informatics and digital health research and development. His recent research in digital health was selected as one of five Asia-Pacific representations to be presented at the inaugural Digital Summit by the European Society of Cardiology at Tallinn, Estonia in October 2019. He demonstrated translational research from fundamental research to solving real-life cardiac challenges faced by clinicians and patients.

He has established his unique partnership in both research and entrepreneurial projects with healthcare service providers from both public and private sectors since more than a decade ago. His research in digital health has spanned across chronic disease management, especially in cardiology and diabetes, to public health management notably covid19 surveillance and management. On top of academic and research recognition, his innovative works in managing covid19 has been recognised by the Sarawak state government and Sarawak State Health Department. He is a key opinion leader who is highly sought-after by local media such as Astro, The Star, The Borneopost and TV Sarawak.
Under his leadership, School of ICT and Centre for Digital Futures have been attracting research funding of no less than RM5 million in the recent years. He is also a dedicated mentor for young talents. He has supervised and graduated more than 10 higher degree research students. His research team members and students won numerous best paper awards in various ICT conferences.

He holds distinguished roles as the Board member of Sarawak Development Institute, Vice President of Society for Design and Process Science USA, panel of the prestigious Yayasan Tun Taib scholarship, and technical committee of Malaysian Standards’ Software and System Engineering.
