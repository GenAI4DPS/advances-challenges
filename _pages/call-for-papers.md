  - Fear of unknown AI/GenAI technologies;
  - Ambiguity/disguised complexities of applying AI/GenAI;
  - Mitigating fear, ambiguity, and complexity of AI/GenAI in critical environments;
  - Irreparable harm from increased levels of AI/GenAI and envisaging penetrative AI;
  - AI/GenAI in automation and autonomy;
  - Qualitatively harnessing the power of formal AI/GenAI design; Exposing gaps in formal AI/GenAI design and process education. 

2. <u>Challenges in Generative AI and Language Models</u>
  - Mastering NLP tasks with GenAI;
  - Proficiency of GenAI/LLM in text genertion/categorisation/translation and linguistic manipulation;
  - Text classification research trends;
  - LLM for anomaly detection on time series data;
  - LLM diminishing returns, credibility and reasoning;
  - Accessing any external reality and criteria of truth;
  - The power of prompts and their adversarial effects;
  - The future of small language models.

3. <u>AI and Applied Science</u>

  - Convergence of scientific data and AI;
  - Specificity of AI algorithms and predictive inference upon scientific data;
  - Differential equations/math solved with AI;
  - Physics informed machine learning for dynamics of multiscale systems;
  - Computer vision for applied sciences;
  - AI/GenAI for material science, scientific processes/research;
  - AI for discovery of drugs/medical treatments.

4. <u>AI/GenAI Applications and Computational Platforms</u>
  - Interactive environments for data analysis and AI;
  - The power of clouds, fog, containers, orchestration, and clusters for AI;

### Submission and review

We invite submission of papers describing work in the domains suggested above or in closely-related areas.

The conference's reviewing of submissions will be **double-blind** and independently peer reviewed. Accepted submissions will be presented either as oral resentation or posters at the workshop, and will be published by Springer as Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS), in the GenAI4SDPS 2024 Conference volume.

The maximum number of pages is 8 with references. While preparing their contributions, authors must follow the guidelines and technical instructions provided by Springer (see [Springer guideline](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and [Springer Overleaf LaTex template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/pringer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WuA4JS5uZpi)).

Each accepted paper must be covered by at least **one registered author**. Registration can be either for the full event (4 days) at a regular rate or just for PhD symposium on October 6, SPDS workshop on October 9, and presentations of peer reviewed papers on October 7-8 (2 days).
