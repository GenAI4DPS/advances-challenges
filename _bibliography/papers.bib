  title={Mediating Mental Disorder Diagnosis and Treatments through Computational Psychiatry},
  author={Radmila Juric},
  abstract={This paper illustrates the potential of mediating diagnosis and treatments of mental disorders 
            by promoting computational models, which could be used in psychiatry. The mediation would have 
            three different aspects. Firstly it would be context aware in terms of patient’s a) symptoms of 
            mental disorders, b) social and personal environments and c) evidence of potential deviations in 
            brain biology. Secondly, the mediation would require a synergy of disciplines and expertise in 
            social science, neurobiology and psychiatry. Thirdly, it would require revisiting the term 
            “computational psychiatry” by deploying the most suitable software technologies which would directly 
            result in the mediation of mental disorder diagnosis. This would mean that the mediation cannot be 
            solely based on co-relation between mental symptoms and mental disorders. It would leave open doors 
            for potential changes in identifying and confirming mental disorders and their treatments, by looking 
            at semantics overlapping between the terms involved in diagnosing mental disorders and impact they may 
            have on each other. Inevitably, this proposal will blur barriers between disciplines of medical science 
            and add social science into perspective of mediation the best possible solution for a particular patient.},

  title={Adaptive Voronoi Binning in Muon Radiography for Detecting Subsurface Cavities},
  author={Paccagnella, Andrea and Ciulli, Vitaliano and Bonechi, Lorenzo and D'Alessandro, Raffaello and
          Frosin, Catalin and Borselli, Diletta and Gonzi, Sandro and Beni, Tommaso},
  abstract={Muon radiography is an advanced imaging technique that utilizes cosmic muons to visualize the 
            interior of structures and materials, making it highly valuable for subsurface investigations.
            In this study, we present a measurement conducted using muon radiography at the Temperino mine.
            We demonstrate the application of an adaptive binning approach using Voronoi tessellation to 
            enhance image visualization and improve cavity detection. The results reveal that the adaptive 
            binning technique significantly improves the visibility of regions with cavities. The combination 
            of muon radiography and adaptive binning through Voronoi tessellation showcases its potential as 
            a powerful tool for subsurface exploration and geological studies, providing a more accurate and 
            reliable approach for cavity detection and characterization.},

  title={Optimizing Deep Learning Models for Cell Recognition in Fluorescence Microscopy: The Impact 
         of Loss Functions on Performance and Generalization},
  author={Clissa, Luca and Macaluso, Antonio and Zoccoli, Antonio},
  abstract={In the rapidly evolving domain of fluorescence microscopy, the application of deep learning techniques 
            for automatic cell segmentation presents exciting opportunities and challenges. In this work, we 
            investigate the impact of loss functions and evaluation metrics on model performance and generalization 
            in the context of cell recognition. First, we present extensive experiments with different commonly 
            used loss functions and offer practical insights and guidelines, underscoring how the choice of a 
            loss function can influence model performance. Second, we conduct a detailed examination of several 
            evaluation metrics with their relative benefits and drawbacks, helping to guide effective model evaluation 
            and comparison in the field. hird, we discuss how characteristics specific to fluorescence microscopy 
            data impact model generalization. Precisely, we examine how factors such as cell sizes, color irregularities, 
            and textures can potentially affect the performance and adaptability of these models to new data. 
            Collectively, these insights provide a nuanced understanding of deep learning for automatic cell 
            segmentation, shedding light on best practices, evaluation strategies, and model generalization. 
            We hope this study can serve as a beneficial resource for researchers and practitioners working 
            on similar applications, fostering further advancements in the field.},

         for the COVID-19 Infection},
  author={Zurlo, Giovanni and Ronchieri, Elisabetta},
  abstract={During the COVID-19 pandemic, a huge amount of literature was produced covering different aspects 
            of infection. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has been shown to improve 
            screening, diagnosis, treatment, and medication for the COVID-19 virus. Applying natural language 
            processing (NLP) solutions to COVID-19 literature has contributed to infer significant 
            COVID-19-related topics and correlated diseases. In this paper, we aim at evaluating biomedical 
            transformer-based NLP techniques in COVID-19 research to understand if they are able to classify 
            problems related to COVID-19. Particularly, once collected COVID-19 publications encompassing 
            the terms AI and medical imaging, fifteen BERT-based models have been compared with respect 
            to modality prediction and task prediction.},

  abstract={To enhance the deep understanding of artists’mindset and technical practices the detailed 
            characterization of paintings require the net of brushstrokes on the surface to be considered 
            as informative. Laser profilometry is being coupled with a macro x-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) 
            device as a non-destructive, non-invasive, portable tool for such an investigation. A set of 
            different brushstrokes was surveyed by testing the necessary sampling conditions and verifying 
            the compatibility with the MA-XRF working conditions. Eight different surveyed sample brushstrokes 
            proved to be clearly informative of a variety of features useful to characterize the gesturality 
            of the artist’s hand.},
