# GenAI4DPS 2024 

The 26th International Conference of the Society of Design and Process Science on Advances and Challenges of Applying AI/GenAI in Design and Process Science (GenAI4DPS 2024) is going to be held on October 6-9, Bologna, Italy. 

[SDPS](https://www.sdpsnet.org/sdps/) has been at the forefront of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research for over 28 years. Founded in 1995, it now has members all over the world engaged in cutting-edge research.  

[GenAI4DPS 2024](https://genai4dps.github.io/advances-challenges) focuses on the impact of AI and GenAI on the design and process of applications now and beyond.
