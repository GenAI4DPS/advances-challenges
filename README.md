# Advances and Challenges of Applying AI/GenAI in Design and Process Science (GenAI4DPS) at SDPS 2024 

The 2024 International Conference of the [Society for Design and Process Science (SDPS)](https://www.sdpsnet.org/sdps/) on Advances and Challenges of Applying AI/GenAI in Design and Process Science [GenAI4DPS](https://genai4dps.github.io/advances-challenges) is going to be held on October 6-9, 2024, Bologna, Italy. 

SDPS has been at the forefront of transdisciplinary research and transformative science and engineering for almost 30 years.  Our international events are forums for challenging  advances in process and design science, computing and software technologies and their impact on research and education.  We are delighted to be back to Bologna, known for their old University and a very vibrant science and research communities.  This is an opportunity to address the main motto of SDPS 2024 conference and debate an inevitable impact of AI/GenAI to research, academia and businesses.
