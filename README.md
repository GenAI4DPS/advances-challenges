# GenAI4DPS 2024

The 26th International Conference of the Society of Design and Process Science on Advances and Challenges of Applying AI/GenAI in Design and Process Science (GenAI4DPS 2024) is 

## Topics

The conference main topics are:

1. **Misconceptions of Using AI/GenAI in Design and Process Science**
- The lack of understanding immature designs and processes, underpinned with AI
- Fear of unknown AI/GenAI technologies, Ambiguity and disguised complexities of applying AI/GenAI
- Mitigating fear, ambiguity, and complexity of Ai/GenAI in critical environments
- Irreparable harm from increased levels of AI/GenAI and envisaging penetrative AI
- AI/GenAI in automation and autonomy
- Qualitatively harnessing the power of formal AI/GenAI Design
- Exposing gaps in formal AI/GenAI design and process education.

2. **Challenges in Generative AI and Language Models**
- Mastering NLP processing tasks with GenAI
- Proficiency of GenAI/LLM in text generation/categorisation/translation and linguistic manipulation.
- Text classification research trends
- LLM as a mechanism for anomaly detection on time series data
- Challenges in GenAI based on diminishing returns of LLM, credibility and reasoning deficit
- The lack of access to any external reality and criteria of truth
- The power of prompts and their adversarial effects
- The future of small language models

3. **AI and Applied Science**
- Scientific discoveries from data using AI
- Convergence of scientific data and AI
- AI ready scientific data
- Specificity of AI algorithms and predictive inference upon scientific data
- Differential equations/math solved with AI
- Physics informed machine learning for dynamics of multiscale systems.
- Computer vision for applied sciences
- AI/Gen AI for material science, scientific processes and research
- AI for potential discovery of drugs/medical treatments

4. **AI/GenAI Applications and Computational Platforms**
- Interactive environments for utilising data analysis and AI
- The power of clouds, fog/dust, containers, orchestration, clusters and computing edge when using AI
- Correlation between simulation and deep generative models
- Intelligent computational edge and AI algorithms
- Applications of AI/GenAI in climate change, environmental science, sustainable building, and engineering
- AI/GenAI when supporting public/personal/mental health, challenges in sports injury rehabilitation and social care
- AI powered devices in medicine, healthcare, autonomous learning, smart transportation, governance and exercising democracy.
